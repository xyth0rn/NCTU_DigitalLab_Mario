# Objects Development Log
- All Objects can be classified into two categories: those that can kill the player and those that cannot kill the player.
  - Those can kill the player: `Goomba`, `Goomba tower`, `koopa troopa` and `poison star`.
  - Those cannot kill the player: `Fire flower`, `Ice mashroom`, `flying mashroom` and `star1~5`.
